# PixelPong ðŸŽ®

**PixelPong** is a classic arcade-style pong game built using C# and Windows Forms. The objective is to prevent the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen by controlling a paddle using the mouse. The ball bounces off the paddle and walls, and the speed increases with each successful hit, making the game progressively more challenging.

## Features

- **Simple gameplay**: Move the paddle using your mouse to hit the ball.
- **Increasing difficulty**: The ballâ€™s speed increases as you score points.
- **Fullscreen mode**: Immerse yourself in the action with fullscreen gameplay.
- **Score tracking**: Keep track of your points as you aim for a high score.
- **Game Over screen**: Displays when the ball hits the bottom of the screen.

## How to Play

- Use the mouse to control the paddle and hit the ball.
- If the ball hits the paddle, you score a point, and the ball speed increases.
